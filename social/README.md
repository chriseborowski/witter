## Technical Highlights

- **Efficient Post Retrieval**: Utilizes database indexing for fast post lookups
- **Scalable User Management**: Implements follower relationships using a many-to-many data model
- **Real-time Updates**: Uses WebSocket technology for instant post delivery
- **Django-based Backend**: Leverages Django's ORM for database operations and user authentication
- **RESTful API**: Provides a comprehensive API for third-party integrations

## Usage

1. Start the development server:

`python manage.py runserver`

## Class Structure

- `Post`: Represents a user's post with content and metadata
- `User`: Represents a Witter user with profile information

- `follow_user`: Establishes a follower relationship between users
- `search_hashtag`: Retrieves posts containing a specific hashtag
- `get_user_timeline`: Fetches and displays a user's timeline

## Performance Considerations

- Post retrieval: Optimized through database indexing
- User timeline generation: Efficient querying of followed users' posts
- Hashtag searching: Utilizes full-text search capabilities of the database
- Real-time updates: Implemented using WebSocket connections for minimal latency

## Future Enhancements

- Implement media uploads (images, videos)
- Add direct messaging functionality
- Develop mobile applications (iOS and Android)
- Implement advanced analytics for trending topics and user engagement
